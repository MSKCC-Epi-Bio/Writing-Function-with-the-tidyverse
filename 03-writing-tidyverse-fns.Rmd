# Writing tidyverse-style Functions

# Attempt #1: Writing a tiyverse-style function

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# outside of a function, this code works
gtsummary::trial %>% 
  select(trt)
# A tibble: 200 x 1
#   trt   
#   <chr> 
# 1 Drug A
# 2 Drug B
# etc.
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# putting the exact (working) code into a function
test_function <- function(select_var){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    select(select_var)
}

# Error: object 'trt' not found
test_function(select_var = trt)
```

* Why does this error occur? Because the `{tidyverse}` utilizes *data masking*

---

# What is data-masking?

.pull-left[
* Data-masking is a distinctive feature of R whereby programming is performed directly on a data set, with columns defined as normal objects.
]

.pull-right[
* While data-masking makes it easy to program interactively with data frames, it makes it harder to create functions.
]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Almost all base R functions use unmasked programming
mean(mtcars$cyl + mtcars$am)
#> [1] 6.59375

# Referring to columns without `$` is an error - Where is the data?
mean(cyl + am)
#> Error in mean(cyl + am): object 'cyl' not found
# R is looking in the global environment for an object named 'cyl'

# Equivalent code with functions from dplyr that use data masking
# Data masking allows you to reference columns without using $
mtcars %>% 
  summarize(new_mean = mean(cyl + am))
#> new_mean
#> dbl
#> 6.59375
```

---
# How to tell whether a function uses data masking?

In a function's help file, the arguments list will specify whether the function 
uses data masking.

# Data- and Env- Variables

* Data masking introduces ambiguity with respect to what you mean by "variable"

* This ambiguity is clarified by indicating to R where to look for an object
(within a data frame or within the environment)

* **env-variables**: objects (variables) that live in the environment; 
usually created with `<-`

```{r}
# example of an env-variable
x <- 3
```

* **data-variables**: variables that live in the data frame;
usually arise from reading in data or manipulating data that was read in to 
create new variables in a data frame

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# example of a data variable: mpg on df mtcars (and mtcars is an env-variable!)
mtcars$mpg
```

* Relation to data masking: Data masking allows you to reference `data-variables`
without specifying the `env-variable` they arise from. Allows for shorthand in
code, but introduces problems when writing functions.

# Two Options for Writing tidyverse-style Functions

* Option 1: Write a function that uses **quoted** arguments in the function call

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# calling tbl_summary using quoted arguments
tbl_summary(trial, include = c("trt", "age"))
```

* Option 2: Write a function that uses **unquoted** arguments in the function call 
(also known as *bare arguments*)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# calling tbl_summary using unquoted arguments (not all functions accept quoted + unquoted input)
tbl_summary(trial, include = c(trt, age))
```

---

# Two Options for Writing tidyverse-style Functions

* Requiring quoted or unquoted function arguments is a matter of developer 
preference

* May be slightly easier for the user to supply unquoted arguments (less typing)

* The type of argument required by the function (quoted or unquoted)
should be specified in the help file when writing functions more formally

* `tbl_summary()` is unique in that it takes both quoted and unquoted 
arguments. This is more work for the developer and isn't necessarily recommended.

---

# Tidy evaluation

**Tidy evaluation:** A framework for controlling how expressions and variables
in your code are evaluated by tidyverse functions.

* Useful for passing variable names as inputs to functions
that use tidyverse packages like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`

# Option 1: Writing functions that use quoted arguments in a function call

---

# Passing Strings to dplyr verbs

* This means that you want to use any of the `dplyr` verbs in your function,
and want to pass a string (i.e., the user is supplying a quoted argument)

`dplyr` verbs: 

* `select()`: picks variables based on their names

* `group_by()`: converts an existing table to a grouped table, where operations
are performed by group

* `filter()`: picks cases based on their values

* `mutate()`: adds new variables based on existing variables

---

# Passing Strings to select() 

A first attempt:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# using a function to select a single variable
my_select_function <- function(select_variable){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::select(select_variable)
}

my_select_function(select_variable = "trt")
# this works, but we get a note
# Note: Using an external vector in selections is ambiguous.
# i Use `all_of(select_variable)` instead of `select_variable` to silence this message.
# i See <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html>.
```

Why did we get this note? *Within the function, it's not clear if the* 
*select variable is a .data or an .env variable*

---

# Passing Strings to select()

One solution is to clarify that we are indicating that the variable to 
select is a `.data` variable

We can do that by using `.data[[ Â· ]]` (`.data` $\ne$ data frame, but is a 
way of telling R to look for a data variable)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_select_function <- function(select_variable){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::select(.data[[select_variable]])
}

my_select_function(select_variable = "trt")
# A tibble: 200 x 1
#   trt   
#   <chr> 
# 1 Drug A
# 2 Drug B
# etc.
```

---

# Functions for Passing Strings to select()

* If we want to select multiple variables, can utilize the following functions

* `any_of()` and `all_of()` are helper functions to select variables from 
a character vector

* `any_of()`: selecting any of the listed variables

* `all_of()`: for strict selection. If any of the variables in the character vector is missing, an error is thrown

* Can also use `!all_of()` to select all variables not found in the character vector supplied to `all_of()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# using a function to select multiple variables
my_select_function <- function(select_variable){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::select(dplyr::all_of(select_variable))
}

my_select_function(select_variable = c("trt", "age"))
# A tibble: 200 x 2
#   trt      age
#   <chr>  <dbl>
# 1 Drug A    23
# 2 Drug B     9
# etc.
```

---

# Passing Strings to group_by()

A first attempt:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_group_function <- function(group_vars){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(group_vars) %>% 
    dplyr::summarize(n = n())
}

my_group_function(group_vars = "trt")
#  Error: Must group by variables found in `.data`.
# * Column `group_vars` is not found.
```

---

# Passing Strings to group_by()

* Passing a single variable to group by

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_group_function <- function(group_var){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(.data[[group_var]])
}

my_group_function(group_var = "trt")
# A tibble: 200 x 8
# Groups:   trt [2]
#   trt      age marker stage grade response death ttdeath
#   <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl> <fct> <fct>    <int> <int>   <dbl>
# 1 Drug A    23  0.16  T1    II           0     0    24  
# 2 Drug B     9  1.11  T2    I            1     0    24 
```
---

# Passing Strings to group_by()

* Passing multiple variables to group by 

* `across()`: allows you to use `select()` semantics inside data-masking
functions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_group_function <- function(group_vars){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(across(group_vars))
}

my_group_function(group_vars = c("trt", "stage"))
# A tibble: 200 x 8
# Groups:   trt, stage [8]
#   trt      age marker stage grade response death ttdeath
#   <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl> <fct> <fct>    <int> <int>   <dbl>
# 1 Drug A    23  0.16  T1    II           0     0    24  
# 2 Drug B     9  1.11  T2    I            1     0    24  
```
---

# Passing Strings to filter()

A first attempt:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# using a function to select a single variable
my_filter_function <- function(filter_condition){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::filter(filter_condition)
}

my_filter_function(filter_condition = "age > 65")
# Error: Problem with `filter()` input `..1`.
# i Input `..1` is `filter_condition`.
# x Input `..1` must be a logical vector, not a character.
```

Why did we get this note? *The character condition needs to be an expression*

---

# Functions for Passing Strings to filter()

* Can use `!!` injector & `rlang::parse_expr()`

* `rlang::parse_expr`: transforms text into an un-evaluated expression 
(i.e., it removes the quotation marks but doesn't evaluate the text)

* `!!` to be covered in next section

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_filter_function <- function(filter_condition){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::filter(!!rlang::parse_expr(filter_condition))
}

my_filter_function(filter_condition = "age > 65")

# A tibble: 23 x 8
#   trt      age marker stage grade response death ttdeath
#   <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl> <fct> <fct>    <int> <int>   <dbl>
# 1 Drug B    71  0.445 T4    III          0     1    8.71
# 2 Drug B    67  1.16  T1    II           0     0   24   
# 3 Drug B    68  0.105 T4    II           0     1   15.4 
# etc.
```

my_mutate_function <- function(mutate_var){
  gtsummary::trial %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(mean = mean(mutate_var, na.rm = TRUE))
}

my_mutate_function(mutate_var = "age")
# mean column entirely missing
# A tibble: 200 x 9

    dplyr::mutate(mean = mean(.data[[mutate_var]], na.rm = TRUE))
}

my_mutate_function(mutate_var = "age")

# A tibble: 200 x 9
